## HW:Speaker identification

You need to implement an speaker identification model combining 
autoencoder bottleneck and Kaldi features
 

Task:
* Learn how to extract features using Kaldi framework
* Implement a denoising autoencoder using noisifier from task one
* Combine features and implement classifier of your choice. I suggest using classifier backbone from task 2
* Use VCTK dataset http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html
* Do ablation study and see which features gave most boost
